Hi - my name is Edward! I'm a recent particle physics PhD graduate interested in data science, machine learning and, of course, physics! I recently finished my 
PhD on the LHCb experiment at CERN and I love taking on new and exciting projects with data!

The repositories here contain some things I have worked on during my physics research. These include some examples of machine learning projects, examples of code implementing 
particle physics models and some quick scripts showing some neat statistical and fitting techniques. 

I am also uploading some little toys which I have quickly thrown together when bored during lockdowns!
